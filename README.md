# Forecalc

**Forecalc** is a core spreadsheet implementation in F# built for research purposes at the IT University of Copenhagen.

## The goals of **Forecalc** are:

* Learn large-scale functional programming using an LR parser, pattern matching, and asynchronous parallel calculations.
* Compare different data representations for large spreadsheets.
* Compare object-oriented and functional programming styles in a substantial piece of software, including testability, maintainability, and code volume.

### 2018-03-13 Update
Solution and projects updated for latest version of F#. Builds and runs in Visual Studio 2017 15.6 with F# installed.
